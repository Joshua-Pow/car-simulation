# Car Simulation Game

This is a learning project which aims to simulate an autonomous environment of cars built using only typescript and html.
Ideally the cars are controlled by a basic neural network which will be implemented in the future.

# How to run

Install typescript:
```
npm install
```

Compile the typescript files using the following command:
```
npx tsc
```

Run the files using a static file server (e.g. live server) and open the index.html file.

# Credits

This project was inspired by `https://github.com/gniziemazity/Self-driving-car` and the corresponding youtube series, but was adapted to use typescript instead
